<!-- When the app starts, the `hero` is `undefined` *by design*
Binding expressions in the template that refer to properties of `hero`, expressions like `{{ hero.name }}`, *must fail* because there is no selected hero

This is the rationale for adding `ngIf`
When `hero` is undefined, the `ngIf` removes the hero detail from the DOM, because there are no `hero` bindings to consider
When the user picks a hero, `hero` has a value and `ngIf` puts the hero detail into the DOM -->
<div *ngIf="hero">
  <!-- Update the binding in the template to announce the hero's name and show both `id` and `name` in a details layout

   The word `uppercase` in the interpolation binding, right after the pipe operator (|), activates the built-in `UppercasePipe`
   Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates, and other display data
   Angular ships with several built-in pipes, and you can create your own -->
  <h2>{{ hero.name | uppercase }} Details</h2>
  <div>
    <span>id: </span> {{ hero.id }}
  </div>
  <div>
    <!-- `[(ngModel)]` is Angular's two-way binding syntax
    Here it binds to the `hero.name` property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow *in both directions*: from the `hero.name` property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the `hero.name`

    When we added `[(ngModel)]`, our app stopped working
    This is because although `ngModel` is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default
    It belongs to the optional `FormsModule` and you must *opt-in* to using it in `@NgModule`'s `imports` array -->
    <label for="hero-name">
      Hero name:
    </label>
    <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" id="hero-name" placeholder="name"/>

  </div>
</div>
