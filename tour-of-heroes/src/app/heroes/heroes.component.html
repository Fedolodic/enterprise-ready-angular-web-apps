<!-- Add data binding to the new `hero` property -->
<!--{{ hero }}-->

<!-- Update the binding in the template to announce the hero's name and show both `id` and `name` in a details layout

 The word `uppercase` in the interpolation binding, right after the pipe operator (|), activates the built-in `UppercasePipe`
 Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates, and other display data
 Angular ships with several built-in pipes, and you can create your own -->
<h2>{{ hero.name | uppercase }} Details</h2>
<div>
  <span>id: </span> {{ hero.id }}
</div>
<div>
  <!-- `[(ngModel)]` is Angular's two-way binding syntax
  Here it binds to the `hero.name` property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow *in both directions*: from the `hero.name` property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the `hero.name`

  When we added `[(ngModel)]`, our app stopped working
  This is because although `ngModel` is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default
  It belongs to the optional `FormsModule` and you must *opt-in* to using it-->
  <label>
    name: <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name"/>
  </label>
</div>
