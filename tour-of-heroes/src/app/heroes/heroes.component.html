<!-- Add data binding to the new `hero` property -->
<!--{{ hero }}-->

<!-- Update the binding in the template to announce the hero's name and show both `id` and `name` in a details layout

 The word `uppercase` in the interpolation binding, right after the pipe operator (|), activates the built-in `UppercasePipe`
 Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates, and other display data
 Angular ships with several built-in pipes, and you can create your own -->
<h2>{{ hero.name | uppercase }} Details</h2>
<div>
  <span>id: </span> {{ hero.id }}
</div>
<div>
  <span>name: </span> {{ hero.name }}
</div>
